# The Timed Javascript Quiz

## This was my 4th homework for my Trilogy labs Bootcamp/ 

I was to create a Timed Javascript Quiz that meets the below requirements.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

```
WHEN I click the start button
```

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

```
WHEN I answer a question
```

THEN I am presented with another question

```
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
```

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

```
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
```

THEN the game is over

```
WHEN the game is over
```

THEN I can save my initials and score



To accomplish this I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript,  and bootstrap. There was no base HTML and CSS code provided by Triliogy for us to work from as we had to create this from scratch. 

The application is not yet completed and I am getting Errors I have not yet fixed
